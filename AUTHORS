Details:
Originally written by David Levine, with major code contributions by Gunnar Teege. Brent Baccala contributed code and suggestions, and Peter J. G. Long made many suggestions and has done an enormous amount of testing. A number of people at eclinicalworks.com made suggestions for improvement and tested early versions of the software. Walter Yuan was always helpful with advice and code when needed.
